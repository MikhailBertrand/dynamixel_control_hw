Dynamixel ROS Control
=====================

dynamixel_control_hw
------------

`dynamixel_control_hw <https://github.com/resibots/dynamixel_control_hw>`__ is a high-performance `ROS control <http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control>`__ package for Dynamixel actuators (`ROBOTIS  <http://emanual.robotis.com/>`__ ).

ROS control is a framework for control loops in `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`__ where the controller code is decoupled from the actual hardware interface.

Dynamixel is a range of all-in-one actuators (motor, gearbox, control board, PID, etc.) addressed through a RS-485 bus, which are very popular in robotics.

Features
--------

* simple, ROS-style control interface for your dynamixel-based robot
* not specific to a given number or set of actuators
* position and velocity control
* works with both version of Dynamixel protocol (1 and 2)
* uses radians uniformly over all Dynamixel models (no need to worry about ticks-to-angle conversion)
* you can set an offset for each actuator's position
* set names for your dynamixels in a configuration file
* joint limits
